<p>I&rsquo;m Sylwia, a Frontend Experience Developer based in the Netherlands, with Polish roots and Irish influence. Iâ€™m passionate about crafting meaningful, useful and accessible digital products. My passion for coding and design is complemented by a curiosity for understanding the broader context and strategy behind the solutions I build.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy walking and training with my dog Oakley, reading psychological or historical fiction, and practicing yoga.</p>
<p>By now I would have expected people to reflect on how we can better learn from the past to focus on long-term solutions that enhance our collective well-being.</p>
<p>This page is my digital garden where I intend to publish all my fleeting thoughts I collect every day. I&rsquo;ve been taking notes -&gt; bullet journaling -&gt; zettlekasten-ing in Obsidian since I can remember. I had many moments when I wanted to share those notes with others and only now I am ready for it.</p>
<p>The topics that keep coming back to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collective well-being and kindness to one another</li>
<li>Frontend Development as a tool for User Experience Design</li>
<li>Making sense of AI</li>
<li>Dog training</li>
<li>Yoga, sup and other activites</li>
</ul>
