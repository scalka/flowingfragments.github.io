# Flowing Fragments

This website is my digital garden where I intend to publish all my fleeting thoughts I collect every day. I've been taking notes -> bullet journaling -> zettlekasten-ing in Obsidian for years. I had many moments when I wanted to share those notes with others and now is the time.

## How to run this project

- `hugo` - publish
- `hugo server` - develop and test
- `hugo server --buildDrafts`
- `hugo server --navigateToChanged` - run server with LiveReload

- `hugo new content notes/my-first-post.md` - create a new file with _posts_ archetype template
- `hugo new content my-first-post.md` - create a new file with _default_ archetype template
