# Hej

I'm Sylwia, a Frontend Experience Developer based in the Netherlands, with Polish roots and Irish influence. I’m passionate about crafting meaningful, useful and accessible digital products. My passion for coding and design is complemented by a curiosity for understanding the broader context and strategy behind the solutions I build.

In my free time, I enjoy walking and training with my dog Oakley, reading psychological or historical fiction, and practicing yoga.

By now I would have expected people to reflect on how we can better learn from the past to focus on long-term solutions that enhance our collective well-being.

This page is my digital garden where I intend to publish all my fleeting thoughts I collect every day. I've been taking notes -> bullet journaling -> zettlekasten-ing in Obsidian since I can remember. I had many moments when I wanted to share those notes with others and only now I am ready for it. 

The topics that keep coming back to me:
- Collective well-being and kindness to one another
- Frontend Development as a tool for User Experience Design
- Making sense of AI
- Dog training
- Yoga, sup and other activites
