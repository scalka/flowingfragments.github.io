# Hej

I'm Sylwia, a Frontend Experience Developer based in the Netherlands, with Polish roots and Irish influence. I’m passionate about crafting meaningful, useful and accessible digital products. My passion for coding and design is complemented by a curiosity for understanding the broader context and strategy behind the solutions I build.

In my free time, I enjoy walking and training with my dog Oakley, reading psychological or historical fiction, and practicing yoga.

By now I would have expected people to reflect on how we can better learn from the past to focus on long-term solutions that enhance our collective well-being.

This page is my digital garden where I intend to publish all my fleeting thoughts I collect every day. I've been taking notes -> bullet journaling -> zettlekasten-ing in Obsidian since I can remember. I had many moments when I wanted to share those notes with others and only now I am ready for it. 

The topics that keep coming back to me:
- Collective well-being and kindness to one another
- Frontend Development as a tool for User Experience Design
- Making sense of AI
- Dog training
- Yoga, sup and other activites


## Work
Driven by a passion for crafting digital products and experiences, I have a solid foundation in frontend development and deep technical expertise in modern web technologies like JavaScript, React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Web Components and TypeScript.

I thrive at the intersection of technology, design, and data, combining my technical skills with a strong understanding of design principles to create solutions that are not only functional but also inclusive and intuitive.

I care deeply about making the web more sustainable and accessible, creating digital experiences that reach and resonate with a wide range of users. I believe in learning and growing alongside my team, fostering a collaborative environment where we push each other towards excellence and innovation.
