# Hej

I'm Sylwia, a Frontend Experience Developer based in the Netherlands, with Polish roots and Irish influence. I’m passionate about crafting meaningful, useful and accessible digital products and experiences. 

This website is my digital garden where I intend to publish all my fleeting thoughts I collect every day. I've been taking notes -> bullet journaling -> zettlekasten-ing in Obsidian since I can remember. I had many moments when I wanted to share those notes with others and only now I am ready for it. 

The topics that keep coming back to me:
- Collective well-being and kindness to one another
- Frontend Development as a tool for User Experience Design
- Making sense of AI
- Dog training
- Yoga, sup and other activites
