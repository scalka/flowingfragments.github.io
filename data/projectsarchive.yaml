      "ReciPy is a recipe recommendation system developed as a part of my Graduation Project. The goal of this
      project was to utilise machine learning techniques to develop a recommender system which can suggest new
      recipes based on user's historical behaviour. Besides development, my work included background research,
      concept development and project management."
    addition:
      'The user can create an account, after login the user can look for cooking inspiration and recipes. Each
      recipe can be rated. The rating system is essential for the machine learning model to learn about user’s
      preferences. The application is designed for users who look for recipes online on a daily basis.'

      with sufficient information about the points of interest on the way to his destination. This information
      includes a short description, rating from other users of the system and reviews. The application then
      plots the exact route from point A to B including the selected stops and provide real-time navigation.'
